## Chapter 1 — What *Is* a Container (Really)?

Containers are one of the most widely used technologies in modern computing. They power cloud platforms, microservices architectures, CI/CD pipelines, edge devices, local development environments, and nearly every Kubernetes cluster in production today.

Yet many engineers—even experienced platform and DevOps practitioners—have never peeled back the layers to see what a container actually *is*.

This project exists to change that.

At its core, **a container is just a Linux process with its environment intentionally restricted and isolated using standard kernel features**. That’s all. No virtual machine. No emulation. No special hardware. Just carefully applied kernel primitives.

By the end of this project, you’ll understand those primitives in depth, and you’ll build a small container runtime yourself.

## The One-Sentence Definition

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

> **A container is a regular Linux process that uses namespaces, cgroups, filesystem layering, and isolated networking to behave *as if* it were running on its own system.**

Every container tool you’ve ever used—Docker, Podman, containerd, runc, CRI-O, Kubernetes—ultimately produces the same result:
*A process that the kernel lies to in specific, useful ways.*

## Why Containers Matter

Containers became popular because they solve real problems:

- **Consistency:** A containerized app behaves the same everywhere.
- **Isolation:** Processes can’t easily interfere with or spy on each other.
- **Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS and kernel, so they’re lightweight.
- **Portability:** Images can be moved across machines or clouds.
- **Automation:** Build once, deploy anywhere.

But without understanding what’s underneath, debugging or securing containers becomes guesswork.

This project removes guesswork.
